    "\n",
    "You are working on a self-driving car. Go you! As a critical component of this project, you'd like to first build a car detection system. To collect data, you've mounted a camera to the hood (meaning the front) of the car, which takes pictures of the road ahead every few seconds as you drive around. \n",

    "If there are 80 classes you want the object detector to recognize, you can represent the class label $c$ either as an integer from 1 to 80, or as an 80-dimensional vector (with 80 numbers) one component of which is 1, and the rest of which are 0. The video lectures used the latter representation; in this notebook, you'll use both representations, depending on which is more convenient for a particular step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll discover how YOLO (\"You Only Look Once\") performs object detection, and then apply it to car detection. Because the YOLO model is very computationally expensive to train, the pre-trained weights are already loaded for you to use. "

In other words, the (0,0) origin starts at the top left corner of the image. As x increases, we move to the right.  As y increases, we move down.\n",
    "- For this exercise, we define a box using its two corners: upper left $(x_1, y_1)$ and lower right $(x_2,y_2)$, instead of using the midpoint, height and width. (This makes it a bit easier to calculate the intersection).\n",
    "- To calculate the area of a rectangle, multiply its height $(y_2 - y_1)$ by its width $(x_2 - x_1)$. (Since $(x_1,y_1)$ is the top left and $x_2,y_2$ are the bottom right, these differences should be non-negative.\n",

    "    - Feel free to draw some examples on paper to clarify this conceptually.\n",
    "    - The top left corner of the intersection $(xi_{1}, yi_{1})$ is found by comparing the top left corners $(x_1, y_1)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex that has an x-coordinate that is closer to the right, and y-coordinate that is closer to the bottom.\n",
    "    - The bottom right corner of the intersection $(xi_{2}, yi_{2})$ is found by comparing the bottom right corners $(x_2,y_2)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex whose x-coordinate is closer to the left, and the y-coordinate that is closer to the top.\n",
    "    - The two boxes **may have no intersection**.  You can detect this if the intersection coordinates you calculate end up being the top right and/or bottom left corners of an intersection box.  Another way to think of this is if you calculate the height $(y_2 - y_1)$ or width $(x_2 - x_1)$ and find that at least one of these lengths is negative, then there is no intersection (intersection area is zero).  \n",

YOLO converts between a few such formats at different times, using the following functions (which we have provided): \n",
